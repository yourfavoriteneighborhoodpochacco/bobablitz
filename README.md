## About the Game

boba_blitz is a cozy-themed FPS game intended for PC users. The game will be released on Steam with a beta version, private launch, and public release.  

Two clashing personalities. 
Cozy meets FPS. What could go wrong?
A lot actually.

Team up. Build. Blitz.

In boba_blitz , comps and strategy matter more than your raw mechanics. boba_blitz is a 7-7 FPS with a cozy vibe. 
Each character has unique abilities and unique weapons to help them win. Build your base and defend it or go aggressive and 
eliminate the opposing team. First to 3 rounds. No tiebreaker. Swap every 3 rounds.


Key features planned:  
- Multiplayer functionality  
- Unique character abilities and progression  
- Immersive environments and art  
- Challenging AI opponents

## Why the Game Isn’t Fully Uploaded

The full game, including binaries and large asset files, is **not currently uploaded** due to:  
- **File size limitations** on GitHub (Unreal Engine produces very large compiled files)  
- **Sensitive files and keys** included in engine plugins that cannot be publicly shared  
- Ongoing development—assets and builds are still being polished  
* I'm currently having difficulty uploading my code and source files to the repository due to issues with GitHub LFS and various Unreal Engine assets not properly being filtered in the .gitignore
  
This repository currently contains **source files, project configuration, and content assets** that are safe to share publicly. These files allow developers to explore the structure of the project or contribute to development without exposing large binaries or sensitive information.
